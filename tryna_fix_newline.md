Of course. Based on the configuration files you've provided, I can identify the cause of the extra newline being added to your markdown files and guide you to a solution.

### Identifying the Cause

The problem lies in your auto-formatting setup. When you save a file, Neovim automatically runs a formatter on it, and the specific formatter you're using for markdown is adding the extra newline.

Here is the chain of events:

1.  You have the **`conform.nvim`** plugin installed for formatting, as seen in `lua/plugins/editing/conform.lua`.
2.  This plugin is configured to run automatically before any buffer is saved:
    *   `event = { 'BufWritePre' }`
    *   `format_on_save = function(bufnr) ... end`
3.  Inside the configuration for `conform.nvim`, you have specified which formatters to use for each filetype:

    **File: `lua/plugins/editing/conform.lua`**
    ```lua
    -- ...
    opts = {
      -- ...
      formatters_by_ft = {
        lua = { 'stylua' },
        python = { 'ruff_fix', 'ruff_format' },
        markdown = { 'markdown-toc', 'mdsf' }, -- This is the line
        javascript = { 'prettierd', 'rustywind' },
        typescript = { 'prettierd', 'rustywind' },
      },
    },
    -- ...
    ```

For markdown files, you are running two formatters: `markdown-toc` and `mdsf`. One of these (most likely **`mdsf`**, the "Markdown sharp formatter") is enforcing a rule that files must end with a newline. While this is good practice, its implementation seems to be adding a newline on every save regardless of whether one already exists.

### How to Fix It

You have a few options to resolve this, from most recommended to simplest workaround.

#### Option 1: Use a Different Markdown Formatter (Recommended)

The `mdsf` formatter doesn't seem to offer an easy way to configure this specific behavior. A more popular and highly configurable formatter is **Prettier**. Since you already use `prettierd` for Javascript and Typescript, integrating it for markdown is simple and consistent.

**Action:**

1.  First, ensure you have Prettier's markdown plugin. If you use `mason.nvim`, you can simply add `prettierd` to its `ensure_installed` list (which you already have for JS). Mason's `prettierd` package includes markdown support by default.
2.  Next, change the formatter for markdown in your `conform.nvim` config.

    **Edit `lua/plugins/editing/conform.lua`:**
    ```lua
    -- ...
    formatters_by_ft = {
      lua = { 'stylua' },
      python = { 'ruff_fix', 'ruff_format' },
      -- Replace 'markdown-toc' and 'mdsf' with 'prettierd'
      markdown = { 'prettierd' },
      javascript = { 'prettierd', 'rustywind' },
      typescript = { 'prettierd', 'rustywind' },
    },
    -- ...
    ```

`prettierd` is well-behaved and will only ensure a *single* trailing newline, not add a new one on every save.

#### Option 2: Isolate the Problematic Formatter

If you want to keep one of your current formatters, you can test which one is causing the issue by disabling them one at a time.

**Action:**

Comment out one of the formatters in the `markdown` table to see if the behavior stops.

**Edit `lua/plugins/editing/conform.lua` to test:**
```lua
-- Try this first:
markdown = { 'mdsf' },

-- Or try this:
-- markdown = { 'markdown-toc' },
```
Once you identify the culprit (likely `mdsf`), you can decide whether to keep the other or move to the solution in Option 1.

---

#### Option 3: Disable Auto-Formatting for Markdown (Workaround)

If you prefer to format markdown files manually (by pressing `<leader>f`) and want to stop the automatic behavior on save, you can disable `format_on_save` for the markdown filetype.

**Action:**

Modify the `format_on_save` function to include `'markdown'`.

**Edit `lua/plugins/editing/conform.lua`:**
```lua
-- ...
    format_on_save = function(bufnr)
      -- Add 'markdown' to the list of disabled filetypes
      local disable_filetypes = { c = true, cpp = true, markdown = true } -- <-- Add markdown here
      if disable_filetypes[vim.bo[bufnr].filetype] then
        return nil
      else
        return {
          timeout_ms = 500,
          lsp_format = 'fallback',
        }
      end
    end,
-- ...
```

This will prevent any formatter from running automatically when you save a markdown file, stopping the extra newlines from being added.
